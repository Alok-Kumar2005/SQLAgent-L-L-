Every workflow ends with a ‚ÄúEND‚Äù node in langgraph which shows the end of workflow. You also need to define a starting node which will be the starting point of your workflow. Optionally, you can also define an ending node if you know the ending point of your workflow. [...] Workflow Automation: \\xa0LangGraph can automate complex workflows that involve multiple steps and decision points. By defining the steps as nodes in the graph and the decision logic as edges, LangGraph can handle complex tasks easily. Langgraph can also make complex RAG systems easy to visualize and implement.',\n",

You define the behavior of your agents using three key components:\\n\\n\\nState: A shared data structure that represents the current snapshot of your application. It can be any Python type, but is typically a TypedDict or Pydantic BaseModel.\\n\\n\\nNodes: Python functions that encode the logic of your agents. They receive the current State as input, perform some computation or side-effect, and return an updated State. [...] By composing Nodes and Edges, you can create complex, looping workflows that evolve the State over time. The real power, though, comes from how LangGraph manages that State. To emphasize: Nodes and Edges are nothing more than Python functions - they can contain an LLM or just good ol\\' Python code.\\nIn short: nodes do the work. edges tell what to do next.',\n",
